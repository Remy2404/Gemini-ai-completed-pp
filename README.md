## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (>=14.x)
- npm or yarn

### Installation
To get your development environment up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```sh
   cd chatgpt-clone-completed-pp/client
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

## Key Components

- **Server Dependencies:**
  - Framework: `express`
  - Authentication: `@clerk/clerk-sdk-node`
  - Database: `mongoose`
  - Utilities: `cors`, `dotenv`, `imagekit`, `nodemon`

## Important Scripts
- **Client:**
  - `dev`: Start the development server with Vite.
  - `build`: Build the application for production.
  - `lint`: Run ESLint to check for code issues.
  - `preview`: Preview the built application.

- **Server:**
